# NS3_Wifi_CSMA
Developed and debugged an efficient sleep-wake mechanism for WiFi devices to attain the optimal trade-off between minimizing the age of information and energy consumption on NS-3 using C/C++ under Linux.

Contributed NS-3 Simulation results in section 5.1 of the paper [Optimizing Information Freshness using Low-Power Status Updates via Sleep-Wake Scheduling, ACM MobiHoc, 2020](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.00205.pdf). Please see the paper for details
